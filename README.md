## Overview
Today you will be using YouTubes API to create an interface for searching youtube. The app should look like the above mock-up.

## A few things of note

#### iframes are weird

We can use an iframe to display the videos once we select them. iframes are a little bit picky about the url you use for the `src` attribute.
To get the video to render be sure to set up the embedUrl along the lines of:

```js
// videoId is coming from the api response,
// to be found at .id.videoId
const embedUrl = `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}`;

// in the JSX
<iframe src={embedUrl} />
```
#### Build out static app before adding api communication

There is an example API response in index.js. Use it to build a static version of the site **first**, then make a fetch request to get live data:
```
GET: https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&key=${keys.API_KEY}&q=${searchTerm}&type=video
```

When building app, try to follow something along the lines of the steps described in *Thinking in React* for building any React application

1. Break the app into components
2. Build a static version of the app
3. Determine what should be stateful
4. Determine in which component each piece of state should live
5. Hard-code initial states
6. Add inverse data flow
7. Add server communication


#### api key

create a file in the `src` directory called `keys.js`.

The code inside should look like this:

```js
export default {
  API_KEY: `<API Key here>`
};

```
